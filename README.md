In this assignment you are going to develop a product management system.
The data in the database is data about products. The user shall be able to create an offer to the
market by putting together one or more products into a group. For example a laptop and a phone
can be put together into an offer. The customer can then buy both these items at the same time as
part of the offer.

Another example is a plane ticket plus a rental car at the destination. The customer shall be able to
buy these two items as one offer.
An offer can be made up of one or multiple products. The number of products in an offer is not
limited in any way.
Some of the requirements for the app are labeled “For the grade VG”. All these requirements must
be implemented and must be working fir the grade VG. If one of them is not working you will not get
the grade VG.

All the requirements that are not labeled “For the grade VG” must be implemented for the grade G.
If one of them is missing you will get the grade IG.
